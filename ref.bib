              sample-level inferences, termed here as differential state

  abstract = "Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential to prevent autoimmunity,
              but excessive Treg function contributes to cancer progression by
              inhibiting antitumor immune responses. Tregs exert
              contact-dependent inhibition of immune cells through the
              production of active transforming growth factor-$\beta$1
              (TGF-$\beta$1). On the Treg cell surface, TGF-$\beta$1 is in an
              inactive form bound to membrane protein GARP and then activated
              by an unknown mechanism. We demonstrate that GARP is involved in
              this activation mechanism. Two anti-GARP monoclonal antibodies
              were generated that block the production of active TGF-$\beta$1
              by human Tregs. These antibodies recognize a conformational
              epitope that requires amino acids GARP137-139 within
              GARP/TGF-$\beta$1 complexes. A variety of antibodies recognizing
              other GARP epitopes did not block active TGF-$\beta$1 production
              by Tregs. In a model of xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease in
              NSG mice, the blocking antibodies inhibited the immunosuppressive
              activity of human Tregs. These antibodies may serve as
              therapeutic tools to boost immune responses to infection or
              cancer via a mechanism of action distinct from that of currently
              available immunomodulatory antibodies. Used alone or in
              combination with tumor vaccines or antibodies targeting the CTLA4
              or PD1/PD-L1 pathways, blocking anti-GARP antibodies may improve
              the efficiency of cancer immunotherapy.",
